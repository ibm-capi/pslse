Quick start instructions for various simulators:

A) modelsim_ase (Free version for ModelSim with Quartus)
B) NCsim
C) VCS


A) modelsim_ase

	1) Build your AFU logic with the file afu_driver/verilog/top.v as your
		top level logic that instances your AFU logic underneath.
		Use "Analysis & Synthesis" to build your model.

	2) Create a symbolic link in your {quartus_dir} to point to veriuser.sl
		that you built when following the instructions in QUICK_START.
		***NOTE: modelsim_ase is a 32-bit executable.  If you are
		building on a 64-bit machine you need to do "BIT32=y make" when
		you build veriuser.sl to force a 32-bit compile.

	3) Start the simulator from Quartus by pressing the "RTL Simulation"
		button.

	4) Each time the simulator is started it creates the file:
		{quartus_dir}/simulation/modelsim/modelsim.ini
		Since it is created automatically you'll need to change it
		every time you start the simulator.  Edit this file, search
		for Veriuser and uncomment this line to point to veriuser.sl.

	5) Get simulator to recognize changes to modelsim.ini file by clicking
		Compile->Compile Options->OK.

	6) Find a better solution for steps 4) & 5).  ;-)

	7) Press the "Simulate" button and select "work->top".  Press OK.

	8) Set up any simulation parmeters you like such as run time or load
		a waveform macro, etc.

	9) "Run" you simulation.

	10) At this point the simulator will be waiting for pslse to connect.
		Refer back to QUICK_START for those instructions.


B) NCsim

	1) Set the CDS_INST_DIR environment variable to the path where Cadence
		was installed.  It should contain "tools/include".

	2) Add the afu_driver/src directory where you built libvpi.so in the
		QUICK_START instructions to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
		variable.

	3) Use ncvlog to compile afu_driver/verilog/top.v along with your
		AFU Verilog files.  Make sure to pass "-SV" as well.

	4) Use ncelab to elaborate work.top with the option:
		"-TIMESCALE 1ns/1ns"

	5) Run the work.top simulation using ncsim.

	6) At this point the simulator will be waiting for pslse to connect.
		Refer back to QUICK_START for those instructions.

C) VCS
	1) Set the VPI_USER_H_DIR environment variable to
		"$VCS_HOME/`vcs -platform`/lib"

	2) Comment out the VLI instatiation code in afu_driver.c

	3) Use vcs to compile afu_driver.c, psl_interface.c, top.v, as well as
		your AFU HDL files. The following command has been tested and
		works:
		
		$VCS_HOME/bin/vcs -q -sverilog -gui -R -file ./pslse/vcs_include ./pslse/afu_driver/src/afu_driver.c ./pslse/common/psl_interface.c +vpi ./pslse/afu_driver/verilog/top.v [path to your AFU]/*		

		When invoked from the parent directory of PSLSE [eg. ~/project/], 
		this will compile the necessary C files, as well as include 
		the needed header files, compile your AFU source code 
		(additional flags may need to be passed for VHDL), link 
		everything, then run the simulation with a gui.
