| Power Service Layer Simulation Engine |
+---------------------------------------+

This repository contains code for simulation and testing of a customer designed Accelerated Functional Unit (AFU) and it's accompanying application by
simulating the connection to the Power Service Layer (PSL) as part of IBM's
CAPI interconnect on Power8 systems.  The "libcxl" directory contains a
simulation only version of the libcxl library functions for hardware provided
at https://github.com/ibm-capi/libcxl.  That code is an abstraction layer that
interfaces with kernel level "cxl" code for communicating with an AFU in real
hardware.  The libcxl code server two purposes.  First, it provides a simple
programming interface for accessing AFU devices.  Second, if code is written
using this abstraction layer then the same code can be compiled with the
alternate version of libcxl.c and libcxl.h found on this repository for
co-simulation of the AFU on most industry standard Verilog simulators.
