| Power Service Layer Simulation Engine |
+---------------------------------------+


*** ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ***

PSLSE now supports either the Power8 implementation of PSL or the Power9 implementation
of PSL.  This is controlled by environment variables:

PSL8=1 causes us to compile for the Power8 implementation
PSL9=1 causes us to compile for the Power9 implementation

You may not set them both at the same time.  This may change in the near future.
Be sure to review the QUICKSTART file for more detail.

This repository contains code for simulation and testing of a customer designed 
Accelerated Functional Unit (AFU) and it's accompanying application by
simulating the connection to the Power Service Layer (PSL) as part of IBM's
CAPI interconnect on Power8 and Power9 systems.  

The "libcxl" directory contains a simulation only version of the libcxl library 
functions for hardware provided at https://github.com/ibm-capi/libcxl.  That 
code is an abstraction layer that interfaces with kernel level "cxl" code for 
communicating with an AFU in real hardware.  The libcxl code server two purposes.  
First, it provides a simple programming interface for accessing AFU devices.  
Second, if code is written using this abstraction layer then the same code can 
be compiled with the alternate version of libcxl.c and libcxl.h found on this 
repository for co-simulation of the AFU on most industry standard Verilog 
simulators.

The "pslse" directory contains the code that models much of the cxl kernel and 
Power System hardware behavior and communicates with the users accelerator 
design running in a third party event simulator.  The hardware interface and 
functionality varies between Power8 and Power9, so there are #defines in 
common/psl_interface_t.h to control which system is being modeled.
